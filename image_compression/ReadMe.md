# Image_Compression

This is an algorithm meant to compress images using a quadtree and a process of pruning the tree based on similarity between nodes and children.



A process of entropy minimization is run to find the ideal splitting point 

Where entropy is defined as follows

-\sum_{i = 0}^{35} p_i \log_2p_i


Where $p_i$ indicates the *fraction* of pixels within a given range of hues defined by

 $h \geq i * 10$ and $h<(i+1)*10$

**Note**    â€”    I wrote this algorithm as an assignment for one of my CS classes, not all of the code is mine (much of it is not). Also, of course, the ideas behind the algorithm are definitely not mine.
