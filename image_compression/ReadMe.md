#Image_Compression

This is an algorithm meant to compress images using a quadtree and a process of pruning the tree based on similarity. 

Images are split into quadtrees recursively using the following splitting technique

A process of entropy minimization is run to find the ideal splitting point 

Where entropy is defined as follows
$$
-\sum_{i = 0}^{35} p_i \log_2p_i
$$


Where $p_i$ indicates the *fraction* of pixels within a given range of hues defined by

 $h \geq i * 10$ and $h<(i+1)*10$

**Note**    â€”    I wrote this algorithm as an assignment for one of my CS classes, not all of the code is mine (much of it is not).
